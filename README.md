# Strava-Activities

These are some statistical visualizations to my Strava Activities.

Strava is a sports tracking app, I mostly use it for my rides, swims and runs.

The left hand side of the dashboard is for rides only, the right hand side is for swim-ride-run activities.

The repo contains a screenshot of the dashboard, the tableau file and the data set in csv format.
